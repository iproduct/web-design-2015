        <p>The Raspberry Pi is a series of credit card-sized single-board 
            computers developed in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation 
            with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer 
            science in schools.
        </p>
        <p>The original Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi 2 are manufactured in 
            several board configurations through licensed manufacturing 
            agreements with Newark element14 (Premier Farnell), RS Components 
            and Egoman. These companies sell the Raspberry Pi online.
            Egoman produces a version for distribution solely in China and 
            Taiwan, which can be distinguished from other Pis by their red 
            colouring and lack of FCC/CE marks. The hardware is the same 
            across all manufacturers.
        </p>
        <p>The original Raspberry Pi is based on the Broadcom BCM2835 system 
            on a chip (SoC),[1] which includes an ARM1176JZF-S 700 MHz 
            processor, VideoCore IV GPU,[7] and was originally shipped with 
            256 megabytes of RAM, later upgraded (models B and B+) to 512 MB.
            The system has Secure Digital (SD) (models A and B) or MicroSD 
            (models A+ and B+) sockets for boot media and persistent storage.
