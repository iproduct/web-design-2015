                        <p>HTML 5 is a core technology markup language of the Internet used for 
                            structuring and presenting content for the World Wide Web. As of 
                            October 2014 this is the final and complete[2] fifth revision of 
                            the HTML standard of the 
                            <a href="http://w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>
                            .[3] The 
                            previous version, HTML 4, was standardised in 1997.
                        </p>
                        <p>Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the
                            latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and 
                            consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers,
                            parsers, etc.). HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but 
                            also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
                        </p>
                        <p>Following its immediate predecessors HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1, HTML5 
                            is a response to the fact that the HTML and XHTML in common use on 
                            the World Wide Web are a mixture of features introduced by various 
                            specifications, along with those introduced by software products 
                            such as web browsers, those established by common practice.[5] It 
                            is also an attempt to define a single markup language that can be 
                            written in either HTML or XHTML. It includes detailed processing 
                            models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, 
                            improves and rationalises the markup available for documents, 
                            and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) 
                            for complex web applications.[6] For the same reasons, HTML5 is 
                            also a potential candidate for cross-platform mobile applications. 
                            Many features of HTML5 have been built with the consideration of 
                            being able to run on low-powered devices such as smartphones and 
                            tablets. In December 2011, research firm Strategy Analytics 
                            forecast sales of HTML5 compatible phones would top 1 billion in 
                            2013.[7]

                        <p>The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group 
                            (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004. 
                            At that time, HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000,
                            [9] and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing 
                            future developments on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed 
                            the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to expire and decided 
                            not to renew it. W3C and WHATWG are currently working 
                            together on the development of HTML5.[10]

                        <p>While HTML5 is often compared to Adobe Flash, the two 
                            technologies are very different. Both include features for 
                            playing audio and video within web pages, and for using 
                            Scalable Vector Graphics. HTML5 on its own cannot be used 
                            for animation or interactivity â€” it must be supplemented 
                            with CSS3 or JavaScript. There are many Flash capabilities 
                            that have no direct counterpart in HTML5. See Comparison of
                            HTML5 and Flash.
