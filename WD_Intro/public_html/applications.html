            According to Gartner, Inc. (a technology research and advisory 
            corporation), there will be nearly 26 billion devices on the 
            Internet of Things by 2020.[21] ABI Research estimates that more 
            than 30 billion devices will be wirelessly connected to the 
            Internet of Things (Internet of Everything) by 2020.[22] <br>
            As per a recent survey and study done by Pew Research Internet 
            Project, a 
            large majority of the technology experts and engaged Internet 
            users who responded—83 percent—agreed with the notion that the 
            Internet/Cloud of Things, embedded and wearable computing 
            (and the corresponding dynamic systems [23]) will have widespread 
            and beneficial effects by 2025.[24] It is, as such, clear that the 
            IoT will consist of a very large number of devices being connected 
            to the Internet.[25] In an active move to accommodate new and 
            emerging technological innovation, the UK Government, in their 
            2015 budget, allocated £40,000,000 towards research into the 
            Internet of Things. The Chancellor, Rt Hon George Osborne, 
            posited that the Internet of Things is the next stage of the 
            information revolution and referenced the inter-connectivity 
            of everything from urban transport to medical devices to 
            household appliances.
