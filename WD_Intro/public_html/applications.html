        <p>
            According to Gartner, Inc. (a technology research and advisory 
            corporation), there will be nearly 26 billion devices on the 
            Internet of Things by 2020.[21] ABI Research estimates that more 
            than 30 billion devices will be wirelessly connected to the 
            Internet of Things (Internet of Everything) by 2020.[22] <br>
            As per a recent survey and study done by Pew Research Internet 
            Project, a 
            large majority of the technology experts and engaged Internet 
            users who responded—83 percent—agreed with the notion that the 
            Internet/Cloud of Things, embedded and wearable computing 
            (and the corresponding dynamic systems [23]) will have widespread 
            and beneficial effects by 2025.[24] It is, as such, clear that the 
            IoT will consist of a very large number of devices being connected 
            to the Internet.[25] In an active move to accommodate new and 
            emerging technological innovation, the UK Government, in their 
            2015 budget, allocated £40,000,000 towards research into the 
            Internet of Things. The Chancellor, Rt Hon George Osborne, 
            posited that the Internet of Things is the next stage of the 
            information revolution and referenced the inter-connectivity 
            of everything from urban transport to medical devices to 
            household appliances.

        <p>Integration with the Internet implies that devices will utilize an 
            IP address as a unique identifier. However, due to the limited 
            address space of IPv4 (which allows for 4.3 billion unique 
            addresses), objects in the IoT will have to use IPv6 to 
            accommodate the extremely large address space required. 
            Objects in the IoT will not only be devices with sensory 
            capabilities, but also provide actuation capabilities (e.g., bulbs 
            or locks controlled over the Internet).[32] To a large extent, the 
            future of the Internet of Things will not be possible without the 
            support of IPv6; and consequently the global adoption of IPv6 in the 
            coming years will be critical for the successful development of the 
            IoT in the future.

                    <td>In order to home into the manner in which the Internet of Things (IoT), the Media and Big Data are interconnected, it is first necessary to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process. It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that Practitioners in Media approach Big Data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals. The industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers, magazines, or television shows and instead tap into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations. The ultimate aim is of course to serve, or convey, a message or content that is (statistically speaking) in line with the consumer's mindset. For example, publishing environments are increasingly tailoring messages (advertisements) and content (articles) to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various data-mining activities</td>

It can also be utilized for scheduling repair and maintenance activities in an efficient manner, by coordinating tasks between different service providers and users of these facilities.[32] IoT devices can also be used to control critical infrastructure like bridges to provide access to ships. Usage of IoT devices for monitoring and operating infrastructure is likely to improve incident management and emergency response coordination, and quality of service, up-times and reduce costs of operation in all infrastructure related areas.[46] Even areas such as waste management stand to benefit from automation and optimization that could be brought in by the IoT.</td>
