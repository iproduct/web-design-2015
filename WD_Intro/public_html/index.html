                        Internet of Things (IoT)</a>
                    is the network of physical objects or 
                    "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors and 
                    connectivity to enable it to achieve greater value and service by 
                    exchanging data with the manufacturer, operator and/or other 
                    connected devices. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through 
                    its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within 
                    the existing Internet infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>The term “Internet of Things” was first documented by a British 
                    visionary, Kevin Ashton, in 1999.[1] Typically, IoT is expected 
                    to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services 
                    that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications (M2M) and 
                    covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications.[2] 
                    The interconnection of these embedded devices (including smart 
                    objects), is expected to usher in automation in nearly all fields, 
                    while also enabling advanced applications like a Smart Grid.[3]

                <p>Things, in the IoT, can refer to a wide variety of devices such 
                    as heart monitoring implants, biochip transponders on farm 
                    animals, electric clams in coastal waters,[4] automobiles with 
                    built-in sensors, or field operation devices that assist 
                    fire-fighters in search and rescue.[5] These devices collect 
                    useful data with the help of various existing technologies and 
                    then autonomously flow the data between other devices.[6] 
                    Current market examples include smart thermostat systems and 
                    washer/dryers that utilize Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.
                </p>
                <p>Besides the plethora of new application areas for Internet 
                    connected automation to expand into, IoT is also expected to 
                    generate large amounts of data from diverse locations that is 
                    aggregated very quickly, thereby increasing the need to better 
                    index, store and process such data.

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>As of 2014, the vision of the Internet of Things has evolved 
                        due to a convergence of multiple technologies, ranging from 
                        wireless communication to the Internet and from embedded 
                        systems to micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).[5] This 
                        means that the traditional fields of embedded systems, 
                        wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation 
                        (including home and building automation), and others all 
                        contribute to enabling the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>

                    <p>The concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as 
                        early as 1982, with a modified Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon 
                        University becoming the first internet-connected appliance,[9] 
                        able to report its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks 
                        were cold.[10] Mark Weiser's seminal 1991 paper on ubiquitous 
                        computing, "The Computer of the 21st Century", as well as 
                        academic venues such as UbiComp and PerCom produced the 
                        contemporary vision of IoT.[6][11] In 1994 Reza Raji described 
                        the concept in IEEE Spectrum as "[moving] small packets of data 
                        to a large set of nodes, so as to integrate and automate 
                        everything from home appliances to entire factories".[12] 
                        Between 1993 and 1996 several companies proposed solutions 
                        like Microsoft's at Work or Novell's NEST. However, only 
                        in 1999 did the field start gathering momentum. Bill Joy 
                        envisioned Device to Device (D2D) communication as part of 
                        his "Six Webs" framework, presented at the World Economic 
                        Forum at Davos in 1999.[13]</p>
                    <p>The concept of the Internet of Things first became popular 
                        in 1999, through the Auto-ID Center at MIT and related 
                        market-analysis publications.[14] Radio-frequency 
                        identification (RFID) was seen[by whom?] as a prerequisite 
                        for the Internet of Things in the early days[when?]. If 
                        all objects and people in daily life were equipped with 
                        identifiers, computers could manage and inventory them.
                        Besides using RFID, the tagging of things may be achieved 
                        through such technologies as near field communication, 
                        barcodes, QR codes and digital watermarking.[17][18]
                    </p><p>
                        In its original interpretation,[when?] one of the first consequences of 
                        implementing the Internet of Things by equipping all objects in the world 
                        with minuscule identifying devices or machine-readable identifiers would 
                        be to transform daily life.[19][20] For instance, instant and ceaseless 
                        inventory control would become ubiquitous.[20] A person's ability to 
                        interact with objects could be altered remotely based on immediate or 
                        present needs, in accordance with existing end-user agreements.[15] For example, such technology could grant motion-picture publishers much more control over end-user private devices by enforcing remotely copyright restrictions and digital restrictions management, so the ability of a customer who bought a Blu-ray disc to watch the movie becomes dependent on so-called "copyright holder's" decision, similar to Circuit City's failed DIVX.

                        <p>Ambient intelligence and autonomous control are not part 
                            of the original concept of the Internet of Things. 
                            Ambient intelligence and autonomous control do not 
                            necessarily require Internet structures, either. 
                            However, there is a shift in research to integrate the 
                            concepts of the Internet of Things and autonomous control,
                            [66] with initial outcomes towards this direction 
                            considering objects as the driving force for autonomous 
                            IoT.[67][68] In the future the Internet of Things may be a 
                            non-deterministic and open network in which auto-organized 
                            or intelligent entities (Web services, SOA components), 
                            virtual objects (avatars) will be interoperable and able 
                            to act independently (pursuing their own objectives or 
                            shared ones) depending on the context, circumstances or 
                            environments. Autonomous behavior through collecting and 
                            reasoning context information plays a significant role in 
                            IoT. Modern IoT products and solutions in the marketplace 
                            use variety of different technologies to support such 
                            context-aware automation.
                        </p>
                        <p>Embedded intelligence[70] presents an "AI-oriented" 
                            perspective of Internet of Things, which can be more 
                            clearly defined as: leveraging the capacity to collect 
                            and analyze the digital traces left by people when 
                            interacting with widely deployed smart things to discover 
                            the knowledge about human life, environment interaction,
                            as well as social inter connection and related behaviors.

                        <h3>Architecture</h3>
                        <p>The system will likely be an example of event-driven 
                            architecture,[71] bottom-up made (based on the context 
                            of processes and operations, in real-time) and will 
                            consider any subsidiary level. Therefore, model driven 
                            and functional approaches will coexist with new ones able 
                            to treat exceptions and unusual evolution of processes 
                            (Multi-agent systems, B-ADSc, etc.).
                        </p>
                        <p>In an Internet of Things, the meaning of an event will 
                            not necessarily be based on a deterministic or syntactic 
                            model but would instead be based on the context of the 
                            event itself: this will also be a semantic web.[72] 
                            Consequently, it will not necessarily need common 
                            standards that would not be able to address every 
                            context or use: some actors (services, components, 
                            avatars) will accordingly be self-referenced and, if 
                            ever needed, adaptive to existing common standards 
                            (predicting everything would be no more than defining 
                            a "global finality" for everything that is just not 
                            possible with any of the current top-down approaches 
                            and standardizations). Some researchers argue that 
                            sensor networks are the most essential components of 
                            the Internet of Things.
